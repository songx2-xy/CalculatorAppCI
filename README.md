# CalculatorAppCI
I got an error said "We have detected an anomaly that violates the CircleCI Terms of Service". I googled this error, it says I have this error because I'm flagged as part of our compliance with U.S. export control laws and sanctions. I don't know why it happen, I'm in the US and my Github account is registered by my school account, so I don't know why this happens. I think I may need to appeal it.
